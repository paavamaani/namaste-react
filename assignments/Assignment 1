- What is CDN? Why do we use it?

A CDN is content delivery network, it has distributed network of servers in different geographical locations. The user is routed to nearest server from his location. The servers cache frequently accessed files improving the performance.

CDN is also used to host JS files, dependencies on servers in different locations and include them in web page using script tag.

Request is sent to nearest server. This reduce latnecy and improve download speed.

Server caches the files and subsequent requests are processed from cache. This reduces load on server.
